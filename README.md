# **Full-Stack AI Tweet Generator with Langfuse Observability**

This project is a simple, fully-functional example of how to integrate Langfuse into a full-stack application. It consists of a React frontend and a Python (Flask) backend.

The application allows a user to enter a topic, and the backend uses a Generative AI model to create a tweet about it. Every request to the backend is traced using Langfuse, providing valuable observability into the LLM's performance, cost, and output.

### **Core Technologies**

* **Frontend**: React (with Vite) & Tailwind CSS  
* **Backend**: Python (with Flask)  
* **Observability**: Langfuse  
* **AI Model**: Google Gemini (via google-generativeai)

### **How Langfuse is Used Here**

Langfuse allows us to see exactly what happens inside our AI application. For each generated tweet, we create a **trace**. This trace contains:

1. **A Generation Event**: This logs the specific LLM call.  
2. **Input**: The prompt we constructed.  
3. **Output**: The exact tweet generated by the model.  
4. **Metadata**: Information like the model name (gemini-pro).  
5. **Usage**: Token counts for prompt, completion, and total.  
6. **Latency**: How long the generation took.

This is invaluable for debugging, monitoring costs, and evaluating the quality of your AI's responses over time.

### **Project Setup & Running**

**Prerequisites:**

* Python 3.8+ and Pip  
* Node.js and a package manager (npm, yarn, or pnpm)  
* A Langfuse account (from [cloud.langfuse.com](https://cloud.langfuse.com/))  
* A Google AI API Key (from [makersuite.google.com](https://makersuite.google.com/))

**Step 1: Set up Environment Variables**

Create a .env file in the backend directory and add your keys:
```bash
# backend/.env

# Get from your Langfuse project settings  
LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY="sk-lf-..."  
LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY="pk-lf-..."  
LANGFUSE_HOST="" # Or your self-hosted instance

# Get from Google AI Studio  
GEMINI_API_KEY="..."
```
**Step 2: Backend Setup**
```bash
# Navigate to the backend directory  
cd backend

# Create a virtual environment (recommended)  
python -m venv venv  
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

# Install dependencies  
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the Flask server  
flask run
```
The backend will be running at http://127.0.0.1:5000.

**Step 3: Frontend Setup**

# Open a new terminal and navigate to the project root 
```bash 
# Create a new Vite project called 'frontend'  
npm create vite@latest frontend -- --template react

# Navigate into the new frontend directory  
cd frontend

# Install dependencies  
npm install

# (IMPORTANT) Replace the content of \`src/App.jsx\` with the code provided in the App.jsx file.  
# Also, install Tailwind CSS for styling  
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer  
npx tailwindcss init -p

# Configure tailwind.config.js by adding "./src/\*\*/\*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}" to the content array.  
# Add the tailwind directives to your src/index.css file.

# Start the development server  
npm run dev
```
The frontend will be running at http://localhost:5173. Open this URL in your browser to use the app.
